# Front End Web Developer assessment

# Summary

Welcome to Flearn Co! We're excited to have you join us as a front-end developer.
Since today is your first day, we’re giving you a simple task to start off with.  

Our designer has come up with a stunning look for our landing page, and we'd like you
to build it for us. The designer has built two mockups — one for mobile, one for desktop.

# Requirements

## Frameworks (or lack thereof)
We're a small company with no existing code, so you can build this with whatever you like.
We love React, so if you're comfortable building with that, we'd love to see what you can do!
Of course, since we have no existing code, we'll be just as happy if you want to use something
else — Vue, Angular, or even plain old HTML and CSS are all fine for us! However, if you choose
to use something other than React or plain HTML & CSS, please be ready to explain the code
to us when it comes time to review it!

## Design specs
- Page background colour, link colour: `#1199ee`
- Primary button colour: `#22aa99`
- Sidebar background colour: `#dddddd`
- Base font size: `16px`
- Main heading font size: `2rem` on mobile, `3rem` on desktop
- Secondary heading font size: `1rem` on mobile, `1.5rem` on desktop
- Headings use a line height of `1.2`
- Our desktop breakpoint is from 1024px viewports and wider;
  don't worry about the mobile design looking stretched, we'll deal with the designs
  for in-between sizes later!
- All margins, padding and other spacing should be in multiples of 16 — `16px`, `32px`, `64px`, etc.
- Elements with rounded borders should use a border radius of `4px`

## mockups

Check out the ![mockups](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1713932/92289058-c2fc1800-eed4-11ea-9f08-1a3c91d96c9c.png).

## Everything else
- For now, the links in the navigation bar don't have to go anywhere; as long as they are links,
  you can point them to anywhere you like.
- The buttons also don't have to do anything or go anywhere!
- We love seeing the use of proper, semantic HTML elements rather than 'div soup'; show us
  what you know!
- We also love the use of HTML attributes that provide extra accessibility; ARIA attributes, oh my!

# Bonus points!
If you have extra time or interest, we'd love to see you implement error handling
for the log in form. For example, can you make the inputs' borders turn red if the user
clicks the **Log In** button when both fields are empty?

**This is not required, and you won't be penalized if you don't do this.** Consider it
a bonus challenge, only if you're up for it!

# Submitting your work
You can submit your work in a number of ways:

- If you've only used plain HTML and CSS, please email the files to us. Everything should work
  if we just open the HTML file on our side
- You could deploy the landing page on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- If you've built the page using a JS framework, you could deploy it on a service
  like [Vercel](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- Or, you can just send us all your code, **but please include clear instructions on how we should run the code to see your work**
- If none of the above work for you, let us know and we'll figure something else out

# Good luck!

We're looking forward to seeing your work! Remember, try your best, but don't worry if you don't complete
this work within an hour. We're more curious to see _how_ you work, and your understanding of front end code,
than seeing a complete finished product.

Thank you!
